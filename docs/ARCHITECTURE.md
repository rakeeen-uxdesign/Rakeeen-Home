# Rakeeen Home — Architecture

Personal life-dashboard PWA (water, focus/Pomodoro, prayer & Quran, fitness, finance,
calendar) for a single user. React + TypeScript + Vite, Firebase (Firestore + Auth),
deployed to GitHub Pages. A companion Discord bot (`backend/`) sends reminders.

This document explains **how the code is organized and why**, so it stays this way
as it grows — whether the next change is made by Hamed, by Claude, or by any other
agent. Read this before adding a file, and see `CLAUDE.md` for the short version.

## The layers

```
src/
  app/        the shell — routing, providers, ErrorBoundary, top-level layout
  data/       Firestore + device-auth. The ONLY place that talks to Firebase.
  domain/     business rules as pure functions + types. No React, no Firestore, no DOM.
  features/   one folder per screen/capability — the React layer
  ui/         design-system primitives (Card, Button, Modal, …) — no business logic
  lib/        framework-agnostic helpers with no Rakeeen rules baked in
  constants/  static data tables (mock seeds, food DB, …)
  styles/     global.css — design tokens live here (see "Design system" below)
```

**The dependency direction only ever points one way:**

```
app  →  features  →  ui
              ↓
           domain  ←  data
              ↑
             lib
```

- `domain/` never imports from `features/`, `ui/`, or `data/`. It's the one layer
  that's safe to read in isolation and safe to unit test without touching React.
- `data/` never imports from `features/`. Components ask `data/` for state; `data/`
  doesn't know which screen is asking.
- `features/<name>/` may import `domain/`, `data/`, `ui/`, and `lib/` — but never
  reaches into *another* feature's folder. If two features need the same thing,
  that thing belongs in `domain/`, `ui/`, or `lib/`, not borrowed from a sibling.
- `ui/` never imports `domain/` or `data/` — it only knows about props.

## Why this shape (in plain terms)

Before this refactor, everything lived in `components/` + `hooks/` grouped by *kind*
(all components together, all hooks together), and business logic — reset rollovers,
prayer-time math, deposit splitting — was written inline inside 1000+ line React
components, indistinguishable from rendering code and impossible to unit test.

Grouping by **feature** instead of by kind means opening `features/finance/` shows
everything about finance in one place. Pulling business rules into `domain/` as pure
functions means:
- they can be unit tested without rendering anything or touching Firestore
- they can't accidentally depend on render timing, refs, or effect order
- reading `domain/finance/subscriptions.ts` tells you the actual business rule
  without wading through JSX

## Rules

### 1. No business logic in components
If a computation doesn't need `useState`, a ref, or a DOM/Firestore call, it doesn't
belong inside a component or hook body. Extract it to `domain/<area>/`, write it as
a plain function, and give it a test. The component calls the function; it doesn't
recompute the rule inline. (See `domain/finance/subscriptions.ts` or
`domain/devotion/prayer.ts` for the pattern.)

### 2. Time-dependent logic takes `now` as a parameter
Never call `new Date()` inside a pure function. Take `now: Date = new Date()` as
the last parameter instead — the default preserves real behavior, and tests pass a
fixed date. Every function in `domain/` follows this.

### 3. Nothing outside `data/` imports `firebase/*`
If a feature needs Firestore-backed state, it uses `useFirebaseSync` (or a future
`data/` primitive) — never `doc()`/`onSnapshot()`/`getFirestore()` directly.

### 4. Imports use the `@/` alias, never `../../..`
`@/features/finance/useFinance`, not `../../hooks/useFinance`. This is what makes
moving a file safe: a file's own imports never break when *it* moves, only when
something *it imports* moves — and that's a greppable, mechanical fix.

### 5. One feature never reaches into another feature's folder
Cross-feature needs go through `domain/`, `ui/`, or `lib/`. If `features/water/`
needs something from `features/finance/`, that's a sign the thing should live in
`domain/` instead.

### 6. Split a file before it crosses ~300–400 lines
Pull out anything presentational and closure-free (icons, small display
components, constant tables) into `features/<name>/components/`. Pull out anything
computational into `domain/`. What's left should be mostly state wiring and JSX
composition. (`Home.tsx` and `Finance.tsx` are still catching up on this — see the
open items below.)

### 7. Name things by what they mean, not how they're stored
`focusMinutesThisWeek`, not `fmw`. `subMatchesFilter`, not `check2`. A reader
should understand a name without opening the function body.

### 8. Every pure function in `domain/` gets tests
Not exhaustive property-testing — a handful of cases that pin the real behavior
(the normal case, the boundary, the one weird edge the comments warn about). See
`domain/day.test.ts` for the shape: one `describe` per function, cases named after
what they prove.

## Where new things go

| Adding… | Goes in |
|---|---|
| A new screen/feature | `features/<name>/` — its own folder, own hook if it needs state wiring |
| A business rule (splitting, scheduling, eligibility, formatting specific to Rakeeen) | `domain/<area>/<thing>.ts` + a test file next to it |
| A generic helper with no Rakeeen-specific rule (date math, a fetch wrapper) | `lib/` |
| A reusable visual primitive used by 2+ features | `ui/` |
| Firestore-backed state | `data/useFirebaseSync` from inside a feature hook |
| A constant data table | `constants/` |

## Design system

Tokens (color, the brutalist card/border language, dark mode) live in
`src/styles/global.css` as CSS custom properties. `ui/` components consume those
tokens — they don't hardcode colors. When the visual design changes (Phase 4 of the
current redesign work), it changes in `global.css` + `ui/`, and every feature
inherits it automatically instead of being edited screen by screen.

**Colour classes.** The runtime palette in `global.css` (`--ink`, `--paper`, `--paper-dark`,
`--bg`, `--sepia`, `--rust`, `--forest`, `--ink-faded`) is exposed to Tailwind through an
`@theme inline` block, so `text-ink/40`, `border-ink/10`, `bg-paper-dark`, `text-forest`…
all work and follow dark mode on their own. Add a new palette colour in both places
(the `:root` / `.dark-theme` variables, then the `@theme inline` line).

**Switchers.** `ui/Tabs.tsx` is page-level navigation (plain labels, a sliding line
under the current one); `ui/FilterSelect.tsx` narrows a list or chart (a button
that opens a short list). Don't hand-roll a boxed segmented control again.

**Theme.** `lib/theme.ts` owns dark/light: `main.tsx` applies the saved choice before
the first render (so every route starts in it), and `setTheme()` switches and saves.

**Icons** are their own small design system, all in one file:
`src/ui/icons.tsx` is the only file that imports from
`@hugeicons/core-free-icons` (raw path data — `@hugeicons/react` isn't a
dependency; we render the paths ourselves). Three exported constants define
the whole look — `ICON_STROKE_WIDTH` (2), `ICON_STROKE_LINECAP` (`'square'`),
`ICON_STROKE_LINEJOIN` (`'miter'`) — and `createIcon()` applies all three to
every icon, overriding Hugeicons' own rounded defaults. **Sharp, not rounded,
is deliberate**: it matches the brutalist card/border language above, not an
oversight. Features import icons from `@/ui/icons` as `Icon<Name>`, never
straight from an icon library — that's what makes "which icons exist", "what
library they're from", and "sharp vs rounded" each a one-file answer instead
of a grep across every screen. New icon → add it to `icons.tsx` first.

A hand-drawn icon-like SVG that can't be a static Hugeicons path set (its own
component, e.g. the TouchID fingerprint glyph in `TouchIDGate.tsx`, a one-off
animated scan effect) still imports these same three constants instead of
hardcoding its own numbers, so it stays visually consistent with everything
built through `createIcon()`. Genuine exceptions, with their own hand-tuned
stroke unrelated to this system: the Pomodoro focus ring (scales with its own
size), Recharts `ReferenceLine`/chart internals, the `MonthFingerprint` dot
weight (encodes a data value, not a fixed style), and `CustomCursor`'s shape
outline.

## Testing & commands

```
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build       # production build — esbuild, so it catches resolution errors
                     # but not type errors
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (strict + no unused locals/params) — keep it at 0
npm test             # vitest, watch mode
npm run test:run     # vitest, single run — use this one in CI / before committing
```

There is no React-rendering test setup yet (no Testing Library). `domain/` tests run
in plain Node (`environment: 'node'` in `vite.config.ts`) because none of that code
touches the DOM. Add `@testing-library/react` + a `jsdom` environment only when a
`features/` hook or component genuinely needs a rendered test — don't add it
speculatively.

## Open items (known, deliberately deferred)

- `Home.tsx` (~1060 lines) and `Finance.tsx` (~1500 lines) still mix a lot of state
  wiring, modals, and JSX composition in one file per screen. The presentational,
  closure-free pieces have been split out (`features/home/components/visuals.tsx`,
  `features/finance/components/visuals.tsx`); splitting the stateful parts (tabs,
  modals) further is higher-risk and is planned alongside the visual redesign
  (Phase 4) rather than as a separate pass.
- `features/calendar/CalendarResetManager.tsx` has intricate rollover logic
  (Isha/midnight triggers, iCal parsing duplicated with `Calendar.tsx`) that hasn't
  been extracted to `domain/` yet — it's tightly coupled to Firestore setters and
  needs care to pull apart without changing timing.
- `features/fitness/` calorie math hasn't been extracted yet.
